Written by: Brownie

Brownie plugged his USB stick in, ready to take a look at the alien transmissions he had received. However, when he opened the document, he discovered that it was all encrypted! Brownie remembered overhearing Tux bragging about a 38 character xor key, and realized that he must have encrypted his document. Help Brownie find the key to decrypt the transmissions!

The transmission list is formatted as a list of strings delimited by ։. Here's an example list: /Z։Tk8V։gF։ue3T։dae9#

Note: ։ is not the regular English colon.
