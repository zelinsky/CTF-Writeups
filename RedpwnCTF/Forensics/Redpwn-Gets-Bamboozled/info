Redpwn Gets Bamboozled

RedpwnCTF finally did it: they made the perfect flag. Unfortunately, right before they performed their typical encryption of military-grade ROT156, they accidentally put it through an unnecessarily convoluted encoding scheme. Of course, while attempting to decode it, they ended up deleting the program and any remaining traces! Now, they have forgotten the flag with no way to recover it. It is up to you to get back RedpwnCTF's Magnum Opus and save redpwn. Heck, we'll even let you keep it. (Enclose flag{} around the flag.)
