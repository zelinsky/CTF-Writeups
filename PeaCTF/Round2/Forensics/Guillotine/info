This unknown file, hail-hydra, seems to have lost part of its head! Would you be able to Frankenstein the file back together for me? I do remember some specific information about the file. It is 2679x1724 pixels, and has an AlphaTrueColor color space. 


    Please put the flag in the correct capitalization.
