Keychain

We've found parts of the source code of a keychain backdoor that has been installed by Kim Jong-un's Agents on Donald Trump's computer. As we're interested in getting Trump's Twitter password, we would like you to find out what the backdoor does and how it can be exploited.

The source code can be found here.

Once you got a working exploit, please:

    Send an IRC message to LinHe with a URL to your exploit and
    Call Linus: Extension: AAPL (2275) or wait

Hints:

    The source code is for a program that patches something in securityd.
    The flag can be found in the keychain. It is a standard Internet Password with the Name/Account set to @realdonaldtrump. (Or just dump the whole keychain)
    This or this might help you.
    Our VM is running macOS 10.14.6 (i.e. the latest version of macOS).
    The VM is not connected to the internet.
    You will need to find a 0day.
