SaaSy

I kept hearing about how popular SaaS is getting, so I launched my own SaaS: Screaming (into the void) as a Service!

My service is unhackable because no matter how much you scream into the void, it won't do anything!

Just to be extra sure, I even put the void I'm using on a totally separate server!

I put a flag at /flag on the web server, but it doesn't matter because nobody can ever get it!

Here, I'll even tell you how I configured the void!
