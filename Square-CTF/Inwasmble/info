Description
After watching you type around on your computer a bunch, you inspire Sam to give the ‘ol computers a try. They decide a website sounds nice. They use websites. Plenty of tutorials on how to make the thing.

“Let me know if you need any help, Sam” you say as you lay down on the couch to take a nice little nap.

Midway through a dream where you can fly but only some of the time for some reason, you feel a nudge on your shoulder.

“Hey, I, uh, need you to have a look at something.” Sam whispers.

They hand over their laptop, and you are greeted with their browser and more browser tabs of Stack Overflow than you’ve ever seen.

“I tried to do what I could,” Sam starts, “but I borrowed some snippets from the internet, and now my site doesn’t work.”

Sam's site.
